		<h2>Company & Co</h2>
		<p>This is an app I made for Company & Co, I used this technology and that strategy. This project was developed in one day (big shout out to khaled and his keys to success). I like cookies and milk, I hope you do to!</p>

		<h2>The Dawn of Dusk: Folio Edition IX</h2>
		<p>I developed this very website you are looking at right now in front of you. My inspiration is what really came through in the design. This project was developed in one day (big shout out to khaled and his keys to success). Check out my blog post for more about pizza and orange pekoe tea.</p>
